Todo:
  ☐ Other
    Add counter types. 
      With closure: cnt.key++
      With object property: obj.key = obj.key + 1
  ☐ Add sub routes to topics on the page
    For example /styleguide:wrapper

Learn JS:
  ☐ Asynchronous programming. Event loop. Event handler. Single thread.
  ☐ Microservice architecture, example.
  ☐ Types of prototypal inheritance: 
    Delegation (prototypal chain)
    Concatenative (mixins, Object.assign())
    Functional (function used to create closure for private state/encapsulation)
  ☐ Functional programming
    Pure functions
    Avoid side effects
    Simple function composition
    Features that support FP - first-cass functions, HOF, functions as arguments/values.
  ☐ Difference between paradigms: imperative/procedural along with OOP and functional programming. 
    OOP with prototypal inheritance (Object.create())
    Classical inheritance (constructor functions with `new`)
